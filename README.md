## What would I have done if I had a whole week

I would have definitely optimized the loading, so after clicking the Load More button it wouldnt't load all of the products again, but will load only the new ones instead. Would have probably added a Description page. If the site's intention was selling or renting vehicles, I would have added more functionalities like registration, adding to favorites, etc, but let's be real, it would have taken me way more than a weÐµÐº ðŸ˜….

I have used ReactJS with JavaScript.
